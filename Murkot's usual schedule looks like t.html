<p> My usual schedule looks like this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Every day I wake's up at 3 p.m.</li>
    <li>Then I go to wash my face</li>
    <li>After that I am heading to the kitchen to drink some milk</li>
    <li>Then I play a bit in the yard and go to sleep again</li>    
</ul>
<p>I really like to sleep because I am still a little kitten</p>
